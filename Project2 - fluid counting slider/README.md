![This is how it should look like](./Images/Project2-bg.png?raw=true "Project2")

This is an example how it should look like.

# Usage

To move slider to right click next and to go back click prev.

![This is how it should look like when extended](./Images/Project2-bg-next.png?raw=true "Project2")

This is an example how it should look like when next button was pressed.

# Some of my thoughts

Next button should be disabled when limit is reached (in this example 4) ✅
Prev button should be disabled when limit is equal to 1 (can't go below range) ✅
Fluid animation on line between circles ✅
